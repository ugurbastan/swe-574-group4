1.	Users will enter accessibility violations through mobile application or web site.

The aim of the project is to determine and report accessibility violations and make people and authorized people to aware of them. With the help of this program, the society can be more accessible.

AVRS will be an open platform for all people. We intend to provide a medium that the access violations can be reported, avoided and hopefully found solution. People will be able to freely contribute and view the society's contributions.
